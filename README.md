# vue-strength

A Vue component that shows a password security.

This isn't particularly useful, it's used as a demo for how to publish Vue components to NPM and work with JavaScript Classes!

## Installation

```js
npm install v-strength --save
```

### Module

```js
import VueStrength from 'v-strength';

export default {
        ...
        components: {'v-strength': VueStrength},
        ...
}
```

## Usage

Once installed, it can be used in a template as simply as:

```html
<v-strength></v-strength>
```
